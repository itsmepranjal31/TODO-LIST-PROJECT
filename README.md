# TODO-LIST-PROJECT
This is a repo to maintain my todo-list website project.
This todo-list takes tasks as input both by keyboard and voice.
It also enhances user experience by effeciently displaying the progress of the task.
once the task is compled strikthrough to mark it as completed.
It takes date as input, which will be futher used to notify user about the task(will be implemented later).
While giving voice input, do wait for few seconds for the task to get added in the list, below the chart.
